**夏，南风**
-----------------------

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.
莲花开放的那天，唉，我不自觉地心魂飘荡。我的花篮空着，花儿我也没有去理睬。


Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.
不时地有一段的幽愁来袭击我，我从梦中惊起，觉得**南风**里有一阵奇香的芳踪。


That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.
这迷茫的温馨，使我想望得心痛，我觉得这仿佛是夏天渴望的气息，寻求圆满。


I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.
我那时不晓得它离我是那么近，而且是我的，这完美的温馨，还是在我自己心灵的深处开放.
